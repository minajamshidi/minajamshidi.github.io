From 2018-2022, I did my doctoral work at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/jamshidi/2482), Leipzig, Germany. I worked at the [Neural Interactions and Dynamics Group](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/departments/neurology/neural-interactions-and-dynamics) in the [Department of Neurology](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/departments/neurology) with [Dr. Vadim V. Nikulin](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/51719/371395) and [Prof. Arno Villringer](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/employees/villringer). In my phd research I developed novel methods for detection and separation of genuine non-linear interactions in EEG/MEG data.

Prior to that, I got my M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from the electrical engineering faculty of Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran (2016), and my dual B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and mathematics from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran (2014).

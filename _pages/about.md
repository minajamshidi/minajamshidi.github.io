I am a fourth year doctoral researcher a Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany. I am also a member of Machine Learning Group at Technical University of Berlin. With a solid background in mathematics and machine learning, I am interested in brain network analysis, especially the networks computed from linear and non-linear interactions between neuronal oscillations recorded by EEG, MEG, ECoG.

I am a fourth year doctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en), Leipzig, Germany. I work at the [Neural Interactions and Dynamics Group](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/departments/neurology/neural-interactions-and-dynamics) in the [Department of Neurology](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/departments/neurology) with [Dr. Vadim V. Nikulin](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/51719/371395) and [Prof. Arno Villringer](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/employees/villringer). I am also affiliated with [Machine Learning Group](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/machine_learning/) at Technical University of Berlin, with [Prof. Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/members/klaus-robert_mueller/). 

With a solid background in mathematics and machine learning, I am interested in brain network analysis, especially the networks computed from linear and non-linear interactions between neuronal oscillations recorded by EEG, MEG, ECoG.

Currently, I am a research scientist at [BIFOLD](https://bifold.berlin/) and a postdoctoral researcher at the [machine learning group](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/machine_learning/) at TU Berlin, under [Klaus-Robert Müller](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/members/klaus-robert_mueller/).


From 2018-2022, I did my doctoral work at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/jamshidi/2482), Leipzig, Germany. I worked at the [Neural Interactions and Dynamics Group](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/departments/neurology/neural-interactions-and-dynamics) in the [Department of Neurology](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/departments/neurology) with [Dr. Vadim V. Nikulin](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/51719/371395) and [Prof. Arno Villringer](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/employees/villringer). I was externally supervised by [Prof. Klaus-Robert Müller](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/members/klaus-robert_mueller/) from TU Berlin. In my phd research I developed novel methods for detection and separation of genuine non-linear interactions in EEG/MEG data. I received my Ph.D. (Dr. -Ing.) from the ECE faculty of Berlin University of Technology in September 2022.

Prior to that, I got my M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from the electrical engineering faculty of Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran (2016), and my dual B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and mathematics from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran (2014).

I received my PhD (Dr.-Ing) from the Berlin University of Technology, with [Prof. Klaus-Robert Müller](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/members/klaus-robert_mueller/) at  [Machine Learning Group](https://www.ml.tu-berlin.de/menue/machine_learning/), faculty of electrical engineering and computer science. 
I did my doctoral work at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/jamshidi/2482), Leipzig, Germany. I worked at the [Neural Interactions and Dynamics Group](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/departments/neurology/neural-interactions-and-dynamics) in the [Department of Neurology](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/departments/neurology) with [Dr. Vadim V. Nikulin](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/51719/371395) and [Prof. Arno Villringer](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/employees/villringer). 

During my phd research I developed novel methods for detection and separation of genuine non-linear interactions in EEG/MEG data.

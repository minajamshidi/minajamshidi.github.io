HARMONI
==========

HARMONI is an open-source Python package for eliminating/suppressing the spurious phase synchronization due to the non-sinusoidal shape of the neuronal oscillations. It can be used in connectivity pipelines for investigating within- and cross-frequency phase synchronization with electrophysiological data.

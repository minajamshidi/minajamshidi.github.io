<b>Summary</b>: This study presents a large-scale statistical benchmark that systematically compares 24 analysis pipelines in a multiverse framework to evaluate the robustness and reproducibility of predictors of BCI performance across up to 11 sessions in 62 participants. Using a longitudinal, session-wise design, it demonstrates that signal-to-noise ratio effects are consistently detected across pipelines, whereas other metrics are highly pipeline-dependent and lose significance under controlled comparisons.

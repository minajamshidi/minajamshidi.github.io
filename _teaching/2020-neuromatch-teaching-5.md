[Tutor](http://minajamshidi.github.io/files/Jamshidi_nma-certificate.pdf) at the [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/) 2020, taking place in July 2020.

The goal of the three-week workshop was to introduce students and researchers to the diverse field of Computational Neuroscience. All the materials are open-access. Please visit [here](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/syllabus). 

It was a great experience for me to be the tutor of ten amazing PhD students and PostDocs during this three-week workshop. I learned a lot, from the materials, my group, my peer tutors, and the senior researchers and lecturers. I believe it was a huge move for online workshops, especially during the COVID19 pandemic time.

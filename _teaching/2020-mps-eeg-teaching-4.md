A hands-on session of the course "Methods in Cognitive Neuroscience" at [Max Planck School of Cognition](https://www.maxplanckschools.de/en/cognition). June 2020.

The Jupyter Notebooks are accessible on [my GitHub](https://github.com/minajamshidi/Python-Tutorials/tree/master/EEG%20preprocessing).

The notebook uses MNE Python and custom-written Python scripts for pre-processing of an exemplar data from an open-access dataset.

Hands-on sessions of the course "Methods in Cognitive Neuroscience" at [Max Planck School of Cognition](https://www.maxplanckschools.de/en/cognition). 

The Jupyter Notebooks are accessible on my GitHub for the workshops of [2020](https://github.com/minajamshidi/Python-Tutorials/tree/master/EEG%20preprocessing), [2021](https://github.com/minajamshidi/MPSCog-MCN2021), and [2022](https://github.com/minajamshidi/MPSCog-MCN2022).

The notebook uses MNE Python and custom-written Python scripts for pre-processing of an exemplar data from an open-access dataset.

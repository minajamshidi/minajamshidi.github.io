hands-on sessions at [CoCoNUT @ MPI CBS](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en/cbs-coconut).

A two-session hands-on workshop on basic graph theory on 16th and 23rd of April 2021. The python notebooks are available [here](https://github.com/minajamshidi/Python-Tutorials/tree/master/GraphTheory/CoCoNUT-April2021) on my GitHub. 

Responsibilities: 
* Notebooks are originally created by me. I created the workshop in the way that participants (~20 persons) can work on the notebooks by peer-programming strategy. They were grouped into groups of 3-4 persons. The groups were in Zoom break-out rooms and I was rotating between them, discussing the concepts with them and answering their programming and theoretical questions.
